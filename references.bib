	abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-two illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several different ways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

	abstract = {The paper is concerned with variants of the successive overrelaxation method (SOR method) for solving the linear system Au = b. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the convergence of the symmetric and unsymmetric SOR methods when A is symmetric. The modified SOR, symmetric SOR, and unsymmetric SOR methods are also considered for systems of the form Diu, - CuU2 = bi, - CLU1 + D2u2 = b2 where DI and D2 are square diagonal matrices. Different values of the relaxation factor are used on each set of equations. It is shown that if the matrix corresponding to the Jacobi method of iteration has real eigenvalues and has spectral radius ji {\textless} 1, then the spectral radius of the matrix G associated with any of the methods is not less than that of the ordinary SOR method with w = 2(1 + (1 - TA2)112)-l. Moreover, if the eigenvalues of G are real then no improvement is possible by the use of semi-iterative methods. Introduction. In this paper we study convergence properties of several iterative methods for solving the linear system (1.1) Au- b, where A is a given real nonsingular N X N matrix with nonvanishing diagonal elements, b is a given column vector, and u is a column vector to be determined. Each method can be characterized by an equation},

An approximate inverse may still be useful, e.g. as a preconditioner. An extended set of examples show that preconditioning a matrix using an approximate inverse (computed in t digits precision) lowers the condition number by a factor Bt. As an example we develop an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations up to condition B2t strictly using t digits precision for all calculations and only allowing for double precision accumulation of inner products.},

	abstract = {From the Publisher:What is the most accurate way to sum floating point numbers\_\_ \_\_ What are the advantages of IEEE arithmetic\_\_ \_\_ How accurate is Gaussian elimination and what were the key breakthroughs in the development of error analysis for the method\_\_ \_\_ The answers to these and many related questions are included here. This book gives a thorough, up-to-date treatment of the behavior of numerical algorithms in finite precision arithmetic. It combines algorithmic derivations, perturbation theory, and rounding error analysis. Software practicalities are emphasized throughout, with particular reference to LAPACK and MATLAB. The best available error bounds, some of them new, are presented in a unified format with a minimum of jargon. Because of its central role in revealing problem sensitivity and providing error bounds, perturbation theory is treated in detail. Historical perspective and insight are given, with particular reference to the fundamental work of Wilkinson and Turing, and the many quotations provide further information in an accessible format. The book is unique in that algorithmic developments and motivations are given succinctly and implementation details minimized, so that attention can be concentrated on accuracy and stability results. Here, in one place and in a unified notation, is error analysis for most of the standard algorithms in matrix computations. Not since Wilkinson's Rounding Errors in Algebraic Processes (1963) and The Algebraic Eigenvalue Problem (1965) has any volume treated this subject in such depth. A number of topics are treated that are not usually covered in numerical analysis textbooks, including floating point summation, block LU factorization, condition number estimation, the Sylvester equation, powers of matrices, finite precision behavior of stationary iterative methods, Vandermonde systems, and fast matrix multiplication. Although not designed specifically as a textbook, this volume is a suitable reference for an advanced course, and could be used by instructors at all levels as a supplementary text from which to draw examples, historical perspective, statements of results, and exercises (many of which have never before appeared in textbooks). The book is designed to be a comprehensive reference and its bibliography contains more than 1100 references from the research literature. Audience Specialists in numerical analysis as well as computational scientists and engineers concerned about the accuracy of their results will benefit from this book. Much of the book can be understood with only a basic grounding in numerical analysis and linear algebra. About the Author Nicholas J.

We have observed that for ill-conditioned matrices A arising in practice, A−1 tends to be numerically low rank, that is, it has a small number of large singular values. Importantly, the error matrix E = U −1L−1A−I tends to have the same property. To understand this phenomenon we give bounds for the distance from E to a low-rank matrix in terms of the corresponding distance for A−1. We then design a novel preconditioner that exploits the low-rank property of the error to accelerate the convergence of iterative methods. We apply this new preconditioner in three diﬀerent contexts ﬁtting our general framework: low ﬂoating-point precision (e.g., half precision) LU factorization, incomplete LU factorization, and block low-rank LU factorization. In numerical experiments with GMRES-based iterative reﬁnement we show that our preconditioner can achieve a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of iterations required to solve a variety of real-life problems.},

Specifically, we use the general HPC problem, Ax = b, where A is a large dense matrix, and a double precision (FP64) solution is needed for accuracy. Our approach is based on mixed-precision (FP16---+FP64) iterative refinement, and we generalize and extend prior advances into a framework, for which we develop architecture-specific algorithms and highly tuned implementations. These new methods show how using half-precision Tensor Cores (FP16-TC) for the arithmetic can provide up to 4x speedup. This is due to the performance boost that the FP16-TC provide as well as to the improved accuracy over the classical FP16 arithmetic that is obtained because the GEMM accumulation occurs in FP32 arithmetic.},

	abstract = {We propose a general algorithm for solving an n{\textbackslash}times n nonsingular linear system Ax = b based on iterative refinement with three precisions. The working precision is combined with possibly different precisions for solving for the correction term and for computing the residuals. Via rounding error analysis of the algorithm we derive sufficient conditions for convergence and bounds for the attainable forward error and normwise and componentwise backward errors. Our results generalize and unify many existing rounding error analyses for iterative refinement. With single precision as the working precision, we show that by using LU factorization in IEEE half precision as the solver and calculating the residuals in double precision it is possible to solve Ax = b to full single precision accuracy for {\textbackslash}infty -norm condition numbers {\textbackslash}kapa {\textbackslash}infty (A) {\textbackslash}leq  104, with the O(n3) part of the computations carried out entirely in half precision. We show further that by solving the correction equations by GMRES preconditioned by the LU factors the restriction on the condition number can be weakened to {\textbackslash}kapa {\textbackslash}infty (A) {\textbackslash}leq  108, although in general there is no guarantee that GMRES will converge quickly. Taking for comparison a standard Ax = b solver that uses LU factorization in single precision, these results suggest that on architectures for which half precision is efficiently implemented it will be possible to solve certain linear systems Ax = b up to twice as fast and to greater accuracy. Analogous results are given with double precision as the working precision.},

The key is a multiplicative correction rather than a Newton-type additive correction. I did not publish it because of lack of analysis. Recently, in [9] a modification of the algorithm was analyzed. The present paper has two purposes. The first is to present reasoning how and why the original algorithm works. The second is to discuss a quite unexpected feature of floating-point computations, namely, that an approximate inverse of an extraordinary ill-conditioned matrix still contains a lot of useful information. We will demonstrate this by inverting a matrix with condition number beyond 10300 solely using double precision. This is a workout of the invited talk at the SCAN meeting 2006 in Duisburg.},

Here we present the state-of-the-art design and implementation practices for the acceleration of the predominant linear algebra algorithms on large-scale accelerated multicore systems. Examples are given with fundamental dense linear algebra algorithms – from the LU, QR, Cholesky, and LDLT factorizations needed for solving linear systems of equations, to eigenvalue and singular value decomposition (SVD) problems. The implementations presented are readily available via the open-source PLASMA and MAGMA libraries, which represent the next generation modernization of the popular LAPACK library for accelerated multicore systems.To generate the extreme level of parallelism needed for the efficient use of these systems, algorithms of interest are redesigned and then split into well-chosen computational tasks. The task execution is scheduled over the computational components of a hybrid system of multicore CPUs with GPU accelerators and/or Xeon Phi coprocessors, using either static scheduling or light-weight runtime systems. The use of light-weight runtime systems keeps scheduling overheads low, similar to static scheduling, while enabling the expression of parallelism through sequential-like code. This simplifies the development effort and allows exploration of the unique strengths of the various hardware components. Finally, we emphasize the development of innovative linear algebra algorithms using three technologies – mixed precision arithmetic, batched operations, and asynchronous iterations – that are currently of high interest for accelerated multicore systems.},

	abstract = {Recent versions of microprocessors exhibit performance characteristics for 32 bit floating point arithmetic (single precision) that is substantially higher than 64 bit floating point arithmetic (double precision). Examples include the Intel's Pentium IV and M processors, AMD's Opteron architectures and the IBM's Cell Broad Engine processor. When working in single precision, floating point operations can be performed up to two times faster on the Pentium and up to ten times faster on the Cell over double precision. The performance enhancements in these architectures are derived by accessing extensions to the basic architecture, such as SSE2 in the case of the Pentium and the vector functions on the IBM Cell. The motivation for this paper is to exploit single precision operations whenever possible and resort to double precision at critical stages while attempting to provide the full double precision results. The results described here are fairly general and can be applied to various problems in linear algebra such as solving large sparse systems, using direct or iterative methods and some eigenvalue problems. There are limitations to the success of this process, such as when the conditioning of the problem exceeds the reciprocal of the accuracy of the single precision computations. In that case the double precision algorithm should be used},

In the traditional usage residuals are computed in extended precision, but more recent work has shown that fixed precision is sufficient to yield benefits for stability. We extend existing results to show that fixed precision iterative refinement renders an arbitrary linear equations solver backward stable in a strong, componentwise sense, under suitable assumptions. Two particular applications involving the QR factorization are discussed in detail: solution of square linear systems and solution of least squares problems. In the former case we show that one step of iterative refinement suffices to produce a small componentwise relative backward error. Our results are weaker for the least squares problem, but again we find that iterative refinement improves a componentwise measure of backward stability. In particular, iterative refinement mitigates the effect of poor row scaling of the coefficient matrix, and so provides an alternative to the use of row interchanges in the Householder QR factorization. A further application of the results is described to fast methods for solving Vandermondelike systems.},

Standard double-precision solvers may return inaccurate solutions or report that no solution exists.

We have developed a quadruple-precision version of our linear and nonlinear optimizer MINOS, and a solution procedure (DQQ) involving Double and Quad MINOS that achieves reliability and efficiency for ME models and other challenging problems tested here.

It makes use of residuals computed in extra precision, typically at twice the working precision, and existing results guarantee convergence if the matrix A has condition number safely less than the reciprocal of the unit roundoﬀ, u. We identify a mechanism that allows iterative reﬁnement to produce solutions with normwise relative error of order u to systems with condition numbers of order u−1 or larger, provided that the update equation is solved with a relative error suﬃciently less than 1. A new rounding error analysis is given, and its implications are analyzed. Building on the analysis, we develop a GMRES (generalized minimal residual)-based iterative reﬁnement method (GMRES-IR) that makes use of the computed LU factors as preconditioners. GMRES-IR exploits the fact that even if A is extremely ill conditioned the LU factors contain enough information that preconditioning can greatly reduce the condition number of A. Our rounding error analysis and numerical experiments show that GMRES-IR can succeed where standard reﬁnement fails, and that it can provide accurate solutions to systems with condition numbers of order u−1 and greater. Indeed, in our experiments with such matrices—both random and from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection—GMRES-IR yields a normwise relative error of order u in at most three steps in every case.},
