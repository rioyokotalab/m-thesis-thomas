\label{chap:preliminaries}

The goal of this chapter is to facilitate a fundamental understanding of the proposed method by introducing the individual concepts and techniques used as building blocks for the algorithm. Each sections aims to provide an explanation to such a building block in a self-contained and easy to understand fashion while providing enough details and further references for the interested reader. Subsequent chapters will then make use of the information presented here as a foundation to expand into more complex ideas. At first, an overview of the mathematical notations used throughout this thesis will be provided, followed by sections dedicated to the concepts of iterative refinement, GMRES, preconditioning and ...
